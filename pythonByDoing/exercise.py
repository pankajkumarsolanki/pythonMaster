# We have a class called Club, and it is initialized like this (no need to change):
class Club:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.players = []
        
    def __len__(self):

        return f"Club {self.name} with {len(self)} players"

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Club {self.name}: {self.players}"

# define a method that allows us to access the i-th player in the club directly via indexing.
# for example, if some_club is an object of Club class,
# we can access the i-th player in some_club like this (you may assume i is always valid):
# some_club[i]

some_club = Club('Arsenal')
some_club.players.append('Rolf')
some_club.players.append('Anne')
print(some_club[1])

# define a method that returns a string representation of this object,
# which can be used to recreate this object.
# The return value should be in such format (beware of the spacing):
# Club {club_name}: {list_of_players}
# the club_name and list_of_players should be replaced by the according value of current object


# define a method that returns a readable string representation of this object for the user.
# The return value should be in such format (beware of the spacing):
# Club {club_name} with {count_of_players} players
# the club_name and count_of_players should be replaced by the according value of current object


# You only need to finish the methods, we will take care of the object creation and call those methods for you!
